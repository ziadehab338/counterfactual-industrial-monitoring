# Counterfactual Explanations for Industrial System Monitoring

# Overview
This project explores the use of Counterfactual Explainable AI (XAI) in industrial machine learning systems. The objective is to enhance transparency in failure prediction models by generating realistic and constraint-aware counterfactual explanations.

# Problem Statement
Industrial ML models can predict potential system failures, but their decisions are often opaque. This project aims to provide minimal and feasible feature adjustments that would alter model predictions, supporting human-centered decision-making.

## Approach
- Develop a baseline machine learning model for failure prediction.
- Apply counterfactual explanation techniques.
- Enforce industrial constraints to ensure realistic recommendations.
- Evaluate explanation quality and feasibility.

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- DiCE (Counterfactual generation)
- Matplotlib
- Git/GitHub
